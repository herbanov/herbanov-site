		<h1 style=text-align:center;>Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain</h1>
		<p>Kain is the youngest son of an aristocratic family, seeking gold and glory in the hinterlands of Nosgoth.  His haughty arrogance has won him no allies. In the mud-wallow, pathetic excuse of a village, Ziegstruhl, Kain is ambushed and slain by a band of brigands.  He awakens to a painful reality in the bowels of Hell.  The Necromancer Mortanius offers him an opportunity for vengeance.  Kain, his judgment clouded by his hunger for revenge, accepts without considering the cost.</p>
		<p>Kain ventures from his crypt and begins stalking the brigands.  He discovers that he is somehow changed.  Water burns.  The light of the sun weakens him.  Villagers flee when they see him.  Yet only after he has slaughtered the bandits that killed him does he realize the full extent of his curse.  Driven mad with hunger by the warm rich scent of the blood coursing from their fresh wounds, Kain gorges himself.  Sickened by his frenzy, he vows not to spend eternity as a vampire feasting, tick like, on the blood of the living.</p>
		<p>At the suggestion of Mortanious, Kain seeks the Pillars of Nosgoth to find a solution to his dilemma.  The Pillars are the mystical center of Nosgoth. Each of the Nine Pillars represents one of the powers that keep Nosgoth "whole."  When Kain discovers the Pillars he notices that they are crumbling. He also encounters the ghost of Ariel.</p>
